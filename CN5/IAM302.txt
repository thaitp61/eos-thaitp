- EFS uses symmetric and asymmetric cryptography<term>YES!

EFS encyrpts files stored on Windows 2000, XP Pro and Server 2003. It is NOT designed to protect data in transit from one system to another. EFS uses symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. 

EFS encyryption occurs at the file system level not the application level. It is transparent to the user and to the application. 

If a folder marked for encryption, then every file created in or moved to said folder will be encrypted. 

There is no back door. File encryption uses a symmetric key. This symmetric key is then encrypted with an asymmetric public key. 

EFS keys are protected by the user's password 

EFS-encrypted files do not remain encrypted during transport if saved to or opened from a folder on a remote server. The file is decrypted, traverses the network in plaintext and if saved to a folder with encryption, re-encrypted.<row>Which statements are true regarding EnCase?

Nessus vulnerability scanner<row>DNS Cache Poisoning<term>One way to misdirect a host, is DNS cache poisoning. The DNS cache stores IP addresses of websites recently resolved. It is possible for a hacker to insert fake mappings into DNS server by using buffer overflow or other means. The SOA record tells how long the DNS cache poisoning will last. 

In order to make the DNS server secure from the DNS cache poisoning attack, enable DNS socket pool on the DNS server. The socket pool makes cache poisoning attacks more difficult because an attacker must correctly guess the source port of a DNS query in addition to a random transaction ID to successfully execute the attack. The DNS socket pool enables a DNS server to use source port randomization when issuing DNS queries. This provides enhanced security against cache poisoning attacks.<row>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Spoofing<term>ARP spoofing is also known as ARP cache poisoning or ARP poison routing. It is a technique used to attack a local-area network. ARP spoofing can allow an attacker to intercept data and modify or halt network traffic. ARP spoofing can be used to attack an Ethernet wired or wireless network. 

During normal functioning, ARP sends a broadcast with the IP address asking for the associated MAC address. A host having said IP address replies with its MAC address. Thus the ARP cache gains an entry matching IP address with MAC address. 

During ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning, ARP sends the same broadcast but an attacker replies with fake MAC address. Now the ARP cache has a false entry and all communication from the host will go to the fake MAC address 

One defense against ARP spoofing is placing static ARP entries on servers, workstations, and routers using the ARPWALL system.<row>The most common way to use this command is with

- As single-stepping an executable in a debugger doesn't require much processing power.

3. Network:
- Host-only private network - may connect to INETSim later.

4. Sharing:
- No sharing or read-only sharing.

5. Disable Windows Defender auto protection and schedules scan.<row>What is Linux VM - INetSim?<term>1. Used to monitor the network traffic.
2. Configured to simulate Internet services (DNS, HTTP, and so on) to provide an appropriate response when the malware requests for these services.

- Ubuntu Server.
- This VM needs no GUI desktop or user applications, so a minimum server installation should suffice.

2. Networking:
- Host-only private virtual network.

3. RAM:
- Minimum recommended setting should suffice, but additional RAM may be provisioned if needed for performance.

4. HDD:
- Minimum recommended setting should suffice, but additional cores may be provided if needed for performance.
